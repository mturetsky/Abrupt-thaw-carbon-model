# Abrupt-thaw-carbon-model
This repository contains files to support Turetsky et al. (2019) "Carbon release through abrupt permafrost thaw".  The repository includes R files with code and model parameters for three submodels that investigate abrupt thaw carbon emissions in 1) hillslope abrupt thaw environments, 2) lowland mineral or thaw lake-rich environments, and 3) lowland organic or peatland-rich environments.  The repository also includes the data files and scripts used to take CCSM4 surface air temperature fields and calculate the mass-based carbon feedbacks per degree of warming stemming from abrupt thaw.  This was done using air temperature fields from both RCP8.5 and 4.5 projections.
